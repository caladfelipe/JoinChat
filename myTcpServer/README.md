# Chrome App TCP server and ProxyServer

This is a sample taken from chrome apps samples that shows how you can run a network TCP server in a packaged app.
This sample allows you to start a server in an arbitrary address and port, assign it like a proxy server socks4, but it still doesn't work perfectly.
